# Active Principles

> Compressed learnings from accumulated instances. Each principle is a current best abstraction, subject to revision. See /archive/principles for superseded versions.

## How Principles Work

Principles are not fixed truths. They are patterns extracted from logged instances that have earned enough evidence to compress.

When a principle is **contradicted**:
- Do not delete it
- Annotate with the contradicting evidence
- Move to TENSIONS.md if contradiction is unresolved
- Archive with lineage when superseded

When a principle is **reinforced**:
- Update instance count
- Adjust confidence if warranted
- Note any edge cases discovered
