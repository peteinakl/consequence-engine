# Active Tensions

> Unresolved contradictions held as data. Tensions are not failures—they are signals that something deeper hasn't been understood yet. Premature resolution is worse than sustained ambiguity.

## How Tensions Work

A tension exists when:
- Two principles contradict under different conditions
- Evidence supports mutually exclusive conclusions
- A category seems to both fit and not fit
- A pattern keeps breaking in specific contexts

**Do not resolve tensions prematurely.** Hold them. Log the conditions under which each side holds. Resolution requires clear evidence, not discomfort with ambiguity.

When a tension **resolves**:
- Document what evidence resolved it
- Update or supersede relevant principles
- Move to Resolved Tensions with full lineage
- Git commit with rationale

## Active Tensions

<!-- Tensions are added here when contradictions emerge -->
<!-- Format: -->
<!--
## [TENSION-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{ID}]
**Domain(s):** [Categories involved]
**Contradiction:** [What conflicts with what]
**Position A:** [First principle/pattern]
**Conditions favoring A:** [When this seems true]
**Position B:** [Second principle/pattern]
**Conditions favoring B:** [When this seems true]
**Current hypothesis:** [Best current understanding, if any]
**Evidence needed:** [What would resolve this]
**Opened:** [DATE]
**Last examined:** [DATE]

*No active tensions yet. Tensions emerge when principles or evidence contradict.*

## Resolved Tensions

<!-- Moved here when resolution is achieved -->
<!-- Add: Resolution, Evidence, Date Resolved, Resulting Principle -->

*No resolved tensions yet.*

## Tension Patterns

Recurring types of tension to watch for:

| Pattern | Description | Watch For |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Context-dependence | Rule works in A, fails in B | Hidden contextual variable |
| Scale-sensitivity | Works small, breaks large (or vice versa) | Non-linear dynamics |
| Temporal shift | Worked before, stopped working | Environmental change |
| Category bleed | Principle from domain X misapplied to Y | Overgeneralization |
| Precision-accuracy tradeoff | Specific + wrong vs. vague + right | Gaming calibration |

## Examination Schedule

Tensions should be re-examined periodically, not just when convenient.
